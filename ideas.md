# Wayward Witches: roguelike async 2

- resource management (several different types of resources)
- more items in plando, but less unique locations (each incantation, etc. locks several checks, some of which may not be plando'd onto)

## new new descriptors

| descriptor      | items         |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| tundra          | Spruce Branch |
| hell            | Cinders       |
| cavern          | Iron          |
| shadow realm    | Void          |
| marsh           | Lilypad       |
| moon            | Stardust      |
| mountain        | Strawberry    |
| under the ocean | Eel           |

| descriptor              | items       | location  |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| tundra & hell           | Incense     | early     |
| cavern & moon           | Chalk       | non-early |
| marsh & under the ocean | Clay        | early     |
| shadow realm & marsh    | Limestone   | non-early |

| mountain & cavern       | Slate       | early     |
| hell & under the ocean  | Basalt      | non-early |

## other resources

| source              | item            | use                |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| goal                | Dragon Scale    | strong spells      |
| everywhere          | Discarded Penny | temporary upgrades |
| non-early locations | Ashes           | many things        |

## issues with previous async / ideas for new one

- efficiency in spending above all else
- add more meta rewards
- remove info from the player
- more temp stuff that actually feels interesting and rewarding for people to buy
- have a resource that you just get a lot of, and have things where each percentage of world completion gives you some (or something) (like bones every location in hades 2)
- don't gate away major items
- goaling gives a really rare currency to be spent on really powerful stuff
