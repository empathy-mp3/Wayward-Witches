# Wayward Witches: roguelike async 2

- resource management (several different types of resources)
- more items in plando, but less unique locations (each incantation, etc. locks several checks, some of which may not be plando'd onto)

## issues with previous async / ideas for new one

- efficiency in spending above all else
- add more meta rewards
- remove info from the player
- more temp stuff that actually feels interesting and rewarding for people to buy
- have a resource that you just get a lot of, and have things where each percentage of world completion gives you some (or something) (like bones every location in hades 2)
- don't gate away major items
- goaling gives a really rare currency to be spent on really powerful stuff

## what are things witches do?

- curses
- spells
- gestures and words
- runes and sigils (and magic circles)
- voodoo doll
- healing
- divination
- love magic
- familiars
- shapeshift into animals
- necromancy (particularly for divination or prophecy)
- arcana
