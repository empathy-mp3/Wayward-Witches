# Wayward Witches: roguelike async 2

an async for archipelago that is itself a roguelike. the sequel to [ENDLESS TOWERS: a roguelike async](https://github.com/empathy-mp3/ENDLESS-TOWERS) (discord thread link: [here](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1264701243603947550/1264701265615781988))
much of the relevant information is being stored on several different markdown files.
this async will be hosted in a different discord server, which will be opening up in... a few weeks, probably.
