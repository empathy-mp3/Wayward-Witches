# magic circle

it seems someone has acquired a Dragon Scale through goaling! these can be used as components in the magic circle, for strong infusions! they may be cast as many times as we would like. all of these start with a 1 Dragon Scale cost. if a particular infusion has been done on *someone* or *something* X times, it costs X+1 Dragon Scales for them to do that infusion an X+1th time. 
please keep all discussion of this in #magic-circle-discussion, so i can see what we want to get in one place.

## infusion of persistence

one random player (who has been infused the lowest amount of times) and one player of our choice  may `start_inventory` *any* item on all of their games.

> costs 1 Dragon Scale

## infusion of binding

1 game of our choice (as in, every instance of a particular game across everyone's yamls) may do an `item_link` that makes things significantly easier. for example, you could make it so that all potions, super potions, hyper potions, and full restores are shared between every pokemon emerald game, and then set the replacement item to hyper potions. that way, there are *many* more healing items in everyone's possession. something like that. we could do something even more powerful, like item linking every "HP Berry", "HP Berry x2", and "HP Berry x3" in TUNIC, and replacing them with DEF Offerings, for ridiculous amounts of defense (which is only allowed because you have to spend money to *get* the defense). i *will* approve or deny these, because they can make survival absolutely trivial. it also very much depends on how many of that game there are. also, OOT item link is broken.

> costs 1 Dragon Scale

## infusion of alteration

one random player (who has been infused the lowest amount of times) and one player of our choice can make 1 yaml change (not the ones we'll find in the cauldron!) on all of their games that they couldn't make because it was too progressive-y. no `start_inventory` allowed.
