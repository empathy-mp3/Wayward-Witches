# trap ideas (specifically things in the skill tree)

main thing to note: 
there'll be some traps scattered throughout the skill tree. they usually have very "fun" effects for 1-3 runs.
if you think something is a trap, you must say so, and then:
- if it *is* a trap, that part of the skill tree will count as completed, and any branching things off of it will open up.
- if it *isn't* a trap, there'll be a 50% chance that a random trap will be sprung.
good luck with your disarming!

- a run in the near future will have `progression_balancing: 0` for all players.
- a run in the near future will have `accessibility: minimal` for all players.
- for 2 runs in the near future, you can't jump (if applicable).
- for 2 runs in the near future, you can't dash or roll (if applicable) (but you *can* sprint).
- for 2 runs in the near future, *all* `start_inventory` will be disabled (but not plando'd permanent upgrades).
- for 2 runs in the near future, if you normally play a game with controller, you have to play with keyboard, and if you normally play a game with keyboard, you have to play with controller. if this doesn't really apply (only keyboard-compatible or only controller-compatible), you are unaffected.
- for a run in the near future, there are no yaml upgrades (including start_inventory upgrades).
- for a run in the near future, there are no item upgrades (except for start_inventory upgrades).
- for a run in the near future, whenever you send a death, you flip a coin. if you lose the coinflip, you lose another life and do another coinflip. (and if you lose that one, you lose a life and do another coinflip, etc.)
- for 3 runs in the near future, if your game has a *hotbar*, you can only have 1 item in it.
- for 4 runs in the near future, all TUNIC games must have enemy rando enabled.
- for 2 runs in the near future, item upgrades are sent several hours into the run.
- for a run in the near future, there will be a 8 hour time limit. there'll be items in the multiworld that add or subtract time (which will all be pre-hinted), and each time a player goals, it adds 2 hours to the timer.
- for a run in the near future, there will be 50 "Doom" items in the multiworld (which will all be pre-hinted), and if 20 are found, the run ends.
- for 2 runs in the near future, many players will start with traps.
- for 2 runs in the near future, collect and release are turned off.
